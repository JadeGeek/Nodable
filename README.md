Nodable is node-able !
======================

Introduction:
-------------

This software is **a node-able bidirectionnal expression editor**.

More precisely, it means **Text-to-Node and Node-to-Text seamless edition**.

To download a binary: go to this [article](https://www.dalle-cort.fr/nodable-node-oriented-programming/). By the way, if you're interested by the architecture, the language or the history of Nodable you'll find some documentation too.

You still don't understand what I'm doing? I hope this GIF will make this more understandable:
